	- and then fix all the bits that assume all units have locations
- error reporting

IMMEDIATE FUTURE
- building infrastructure
	- cartwright builds new units
	- counting house enables trade in scrip
	- production buildings lower value of output commodities & increase value of inputs
	- housing increases housing
	- defenses increase defense
- draw functions for units
- cartwright
- movement animation/transition
- rejigger site labels for legibilityâ€¦ somehow
- surveyer unit (sees hidden natural resources)
- increasing vision ?

FAR FUTURE

- transfer cargo (besides selling and buying)


EVENTS
