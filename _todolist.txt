Down the Phoenix Road To Do List


DONE

units at sites that have routes display with green outline


IMMEDIATE FIXES

Delivering cargo that is USED but not produced (and not common) should, after initial adjustement, also return to set point

all units in transit are displayed in tabs on load (?!?)

pop up for 'need more food/water/fuel' needs to say 'caravan' when appropriate

build complete does not focus on builder?

NEXT FEATURE / OPTIMIZATION

- non-common commodities & commodities not produced locally do not return to set point

- SVG tinkering
	- movement animation/transition

- selectUnit zooming animated

- when multiple units are at a site, stagger them on the map

save tutorial on/off

FUTURE EXPANSIONS

- pop up display for 'who do I know that makes this commodity?'

- New Random Events
	- site discovers resource
	- events that earn you reputation in towns
	- increase to your self-defense
	- plague events
		- slowly increases values
		- population loss
		- spreads town to town
		- can deliver medicine commodities to cure them (not an event, but still)

- New Infrastructure
	- Canals for flood control (and other benefits?)
	- Cisterns fight fire events (50%)
	- Fire Station kills fire events (100%)
	- Clinic/Hospital for Plague?
	- construction crew upgrades to industry infrastructure?
	- Library (requires Old World Ruins)
		- research to discover resources in other sites
		- research to discover sites outside your knownSites

- Refugees Upgrade
	- have a global count of refugees
	- when a site's hunger gets too crazy (or the other bars?), people leave town
	- when refugees arrive in a site or you find a camp, reduce the global refugee count
	- refugees arrive at ghost town needs different text

- event log (ie, 'crap what did I just click past?')

- Post Office as a infrastructure box
	- only one or two mails available at a time
	- addressed to specific destination site?
	
- Threats Upgrade
	- you can discover their home base
	- you can nullify a threat / reduce its strength
	- arrival events
		- they ask for intel, which queues a raid where they have an advantage
		- tax goods (can take percentage of loads)
		- confiscate goods (take a whole load)

- Affecting Wages
	- union house
	- school
	- house of worship

- Warehousing
	- works like trash pile except it doesn't disappear
	- build costs will need to take warehouses into account
	- scuttled units in that location stash commodities in warehouse

- Swamps
	- a 'resource' that can be drained to turn it into River
	- must add sites with swamp to the rivers setup

- Population Growth

- a 'notes' file that saves with game so you can tell Future Self what your strategy is

- Graph Expansion
	- trailblazing
	- building outposts / new sites

- other only-findable infrastructures?
	- some kind of cult?
	- eventually, enough findable locations that not all of them appear in each play

- what do you do that starts passively spreading civilization / greening needs?
	- once you get a site in the green on all counts, it starts pushing help outward
	- people start migrating out of shitty sites and into green sites (event)

- what can you DISCOVER that greatly helps a lot of towns directly?




MOTHBALLS
- odd jobs button
	- in ten days you get half-loads of food and water
	- your rep there dips down the price of a full load of food and water.
	- appears only when you have less than a week's provisions and no local rep
- Construction and Surveying require food
	(replaced by 'join the community' consequences)
- boats? terrain?
- zoom in / out pays no attention to the location of the mouse
	- need to set a center point (defaults to 500,500 or focus unit?)
	- or takes its value initially but then ignores it until zoom is done?
