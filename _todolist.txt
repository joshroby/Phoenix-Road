Down the Phoenix Road To Do List


DONE

- double wages calculation

- increase survey time

- Mechanic and Hanger events have the name of the town as the passage speaker

- units scale in zoom like site names do




IMMEDIATE FIXES

- cache has trading items?

- still not taking commodities out of non-focus unitsAtSite

- increase the borders of the map, even though the used bit is never more than 1000x1000
	- this will help zoom

- ghost towns do not display infrastructure… including recruitables like the burnt-out bus

- when unit scuttles, only sell what is traded there; warehouse/trash the rest

- aurochs event (and probably banditry) relies on focus.unit which isn't getting reliably set by event initialization

- 'drought in <ghost town>' is silly

NEXT FEATURE / OPTIMIZATION

- a site with inputs should BUY those inputs but not sell them.  Figure that chestnut out.
	- split Site.trading() into Site.buying() and Site.selling()

- when a unit arrives at a site, switch off Offroad automatically
	- pop up notification?

- event pop up when you use an upgrade site

- marker on map to indicate amount of credit you have at different sites

- make the randomevents list sequester what just happened so you don't get repeats
	- slowly feed sequestered events back in

- event log (ie, 'crap what did I just click past?')

- when you drop passengers into a ghost town with no neighbors, check to see if nearest neighbor is within max dist and create a road (both ways)

- tinker pulldown displays something to indicate what can and can't be built

- New Random Events
	- threat gains strength
	- threat loses strength
	- site discovers resource
	- events that earn you reputation in towns
	- increase to your self-defense
	- plague events
		- slowly increases values
		- population loss
		- spreads town to town
		- can deliver medicine commodities to cure them (not an event, but still)
	- respawn event
		- checks if Tinker Camp, Cartwright, Mechanic, Arena, Lensmeister exist
		- if one doesn't, it spawns one.
		- notifies you if it's a town you've visited
		- if Tinker Camp / Mechanic is destroyed in an event, game goes unwinnable.


- event log (ie, 'crap what did I just click past?')

- Post Office as a infrastructure box
	- only one or two mails available at a time
	- addressed to specific destination site?
	
- Playing with Threats
	- you can discover their home base
	- you can nullify a threat / reduce its strength
	- view.displaySiteDetails to show threat territory if you've visited
	- arrival events
		- ask for intel, which increases danger of knownSites
		- tax goods (can take percentage of loads)
		- confiscate goods (take a whole load)
- overhaul production buildings effect on values
	- port it over to the adjustments code
	- make eachDay's adjustments go up and down pipelines
	- infrastructure with no local source for inputs does not decrease outputs
- SVG tinkering
	- movement animation/transition
	- landmark draw functions
- Zoom is still wonky
	- zoom in / out pays no attention to the location of the mouse
		- need to set a center point (defaults to 500,500 or focus unit?)
		- or takes its value initially but then ignores it until zoom is done?
- New Infrastructure
	- Canals for flood control (and other benefits?)
	- Cisterns fight fire events (50%)
	- Fire Station kills fire events (100%)
	- Clinic/Hospital for Plague?
- Populate and test the Event Stack
- Cancel route while in the midst of route.  Use "Roadside" code.

- If you get hit by bandits and surrender the cargo before you get to your first destination, the tutorial craps out.  Maybe prevent bandits from spawning for the first ten days or something?

GAMEN
	color palette
	pronoun substitution
	prettyNumber(2) -> "two"
	responsive design in the CSS

FUTURE EXPANSIONS
- a 'notes' file that saves with game so you can tell Future Self what your strategy is
- how do you affect wages?
	- union house
	- school
	- house of worship
- what benefit do YOU get for building housing?
	- housing defends against plague and… what other random events?
- trailblazing
- building outposts / new sites
- warehousing
	- works like trash pile except it doesn't disappear
	- build costs will need to take warehouses into account
- other only-findable infrastructures?
	- some kind of cult?
	- eventually, enough findable locations that not all of them appear in each play
- what do you do that starts passively spreading civilization / greening needs?
	- once you get a site in the green on all counts, it starts pushing help outward
- swamp 'resource' that can be drained to get… something
- what can you DISCOVER that greatly helps a lot of towns directly?

- link up the sites with rivers (ha ha, that's funny hard)
	- make a list of all sites with rivers
	- find each river-site's nearest river-site neighbor
	- link up like normal neighbors with a curvy river segment
	- (how to avoid overlapping other sites?)




MOTHBALLS
- odd jobs button
	- in ten days you get half-loads of food and water
	- your rep there dips down the price of a full load of food and water.
	- appears only when you have less than a week's provisions and no local rep
- Construction and Surveying require food
	(replaced by 'join the community' consequences)
- boats? terrain?
