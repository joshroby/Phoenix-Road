Down the Phoenix Road To Do List


- player does not start in a ghost town
- threats are harbored in sites
- threats have names, strengths, and target lists
- each site has its nearestThreat logged
- Site.needs() safety is gauged against the site's nearestThreat's strength
- everything saves and loads


IMMEDIATE

NEAR FUTURE

- Post Office as a infrastructure box
	- only one or two mails available at a time
	- addressed to specific destination site?
- Threats
	- what if threats are just sites with events on arrival?
		- can you 'civilize' them / make them not threats?
		- arrival events
			- ask for intel, which increases danger of knownSites
			- tax goods (can take percentage of loads)
			- confiscate goods (take a whole load)
	- or, pull threats off of the sites array before trimming (to maintain space)
		- give threats names
		- make them discoverable (not via vision, tho?)
- overhaul production buildings affect on values
	- port it over to the adjustments code
	- make adjustments go up and down pipelines
	- infrastructure with no local source for inputs does not decrease outputs
- SVG tinkering
	- movement animation/transition
	- shading on landmarks
	- fix unit svgs to have no overlapping paths
		- then can implement the background stroke
- Zoom is still wonky
	- need to set a center point (defaults to 500,500 or focus unit?)
	- zoom in / out pays no attention to the location of the mouse
		- or takes its value initially but then ignores it until zoom is done?
	- adjust label text size so it does not zoom along with map
- New Infrastructure
	- Canals for flood control (and other benefits?)
	- Cisterns fight fire events (50%)
	- Fire Station kills fire events (100%)
	- Clinic/Hospital for Plague?
- Slider Speed Control


GAMEN
	index.html content setup/injection
	color palette
	pronoun substitution

FAR FUTURE
- eventually, enough findable locations that not all of them appear in each play
- a 'notes' file that saves with game so you can tell Future Self what your strategy is
- how do you affect wages?
	- union house
- what benefit do YOU get for building defenses and housing?
- rejigger site labels for legibilityâ€¦ somehow
- trailblazing
- building outposts / new sites
- warlord territory
- warehousing
	- works like trash pile except it doesn't disappear
	- build costs will need to take warehouses into account
- other only-findable infrastructures?
	- some kind of cult?
	- dojo / train your drivers to defend themselves from bandits, etc (upgrade)
- responsive design in the CSS
- what do you do that starts passively spreading civilization / greening needs?
- two builder units building the same thing at the same time

- what can you DISCOVER that greatly helps a lot of towns directly?


EVENTS
- plague event which slowly increases values and kills population, can deliver medicine commodities to cure them
- increasing / decreasing danger
- consequences for suboptimal needs?
- events that earn you reputation in towns





MOTHBALLS
- odd jobs button
	- in ten days you get half-loads of food and water
	- your rep there dips down the price of a full load of food and water.
	- appears only when you have less than a week's provisions and no local rep
- Construction and Surveying require food
	(replaced by 'join the community' consequences)
- boats? terrain?
