Down the Phoenix Road To Do List


DONE

units at sites that have routes display with green outline

- commodities return to set point after adjustments if:
	- they are common
	- they are produced there
	- they are consumed there

- when multiple units are at a site, map displays them spaced out

- recruit function needs to hit view.displayMap()
- build infrastructure button needs to hit view.displayMap()
- scuttle needs to hit view.displayMap()
	- and is it not clearing view.focus.unit?

- cursor over map always arrow

- Naked Dowser moved to localArea

fixed error in Scrapyard button not working

- Unit.departed flag saved and loads

- Today's saves display time correctly

IMMEDIATE FIXES

- build infrastructure checks if other units have commodities but does not deduct them.  Charges reputation into the negatives instead.

NEXT FEATURE / OPTIMIZATION

- clear up Unit.route code to use the last route.to rather than the standalone site reference at the last index

- Mysterious Site needs two options: "Hold Up" which hits Unit.roadside() for you, or "Continue onwards" which is just dismiss

- SVG tinkering
	- movement animation/transition

- selectUnit zooming animated

- save tutorial on/off state

- a big and unmistakable select circle behind the view.focus.unit

FUTURE EXPANSIONS

- pop up display for 'who do I know that makes this commodity?'

- New Random Events
	- site discovers resource
	- events that earn you reputation in towns
	- increase to your self-defense
	- a very simple 'you get some food'
		- replenishes a food to 100 rather than gives you a new commodity
	- plague events
		- slowly increases values
		- population loss
		- spreads town to town
		- can deliver medicine commodities to cure them (not an event, but still)

- New Infrastructure
	- Canals for flood control (and other benefits?)
	- Cisterns fight fire events (50%)
	- Fire Station kills fire events (100%)
	- Clinic/Hospital for Plague?
	- construction crew upgrades to industry infrastructure?
	- Library (requires Old World Ruins)
		- research to discover resources in other sites
		- research to discover sites outside your knownSites

- Refugees Upgrade
	- have a global count of refugees
	- when a site's hunger gets too crazy (or the other bars?), people leave town
	- when refugees arrive in a site or you find a camp, reduce the global refugee count
	- refugees arrive at ghost town needs different text

- event log (ie, 'crap what did I just click past?')

- Post Office as a infrastructure box
	- only one or two mails available at a time
	- addressed to specific destination site?
	
- Threats Upgrade
	- you can discover their home base
	- you can nullify a threat / reduce its strength
	- arrival events
		- they ask for intel, which queues a raid where they have an advantage
		- tax goods (can take percentage of loads)
		- confiscate goods (take a whole load)

- Affecting Wages
	- union house
	- school
	- house of worship

- Warehousing
	- works like trash pile except it doesn't disappear
	- build costs will need to take warehouses into account
	- scuttled units in that location stash commodities in warehouse

- Swamps
	- a 'resource' that can be drained to turn it into River
	- must add sites with swamp to the rivers setup

- Population Growth

- a 'notes' file that saves with game so you can tell Future Self what your strategy is

- Graph Expansion
	- trailblazing
	- building outposts / new sites

- other only-findable infrastructures?
	- some kind of cult?
	- eventually, enough findable locations that not all of them appear in each play

- what do you do that starts passively spreading civilization / greening needs?
	- once you get a site in the green on all counts, it starts pushing help outward
	- people start migrating out of shitty sites and into green sites (event)

- what can you DISCOVER that greatly helps a lot of towns directly?

- Outriders and Escorts
	- no cargo but provides manpower/defense


MOTHBALLS
- odd jobs button
	- in ten days you get half-loads of food and water
	- your rep there dips down the price of a full load of food and water.
	- appears only when you have less than a week's provisions and no local rep
- Construction and Surveying require food
	(replaced by 'join the community' consequences)
- boats? terrain?
- zoom in / out pays no attention to the location of the mouse
	- need to set a center point (defaults to 500,500 or focus unit?)
	- or takes its value initially but then ignores it until zoom is done?
