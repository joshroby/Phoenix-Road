Down the Phoenix Road To Do List



PERNICIOUS PROBLEMS
- site label onmouseout that returns site details to the focus unit's location

NEAR FUTURE
- enable/disable build buttons by selections
- dump cargo when you can't sell it
- view.enableUnitAddBtns() tries to enable buttons for commodities that aren't traded there
- build times?

IMMEDIATE FUTURE
- zoom function's impression of where cursor is on map is derived as if map is zoomed out
- pathfinding for multi-step trips
- draw functions for units
- movement animation/transition
- rejigger site labels for legibilityâ€¦ somehow
- other only-findable infrastructures
	- zeppelin hanger
	- some kind of cult?
- stone wall replaces pallisade & other such issues

FAR FUTURE
- boats? terrain?
- trailblazing
- building outposts / new sites
- hardholder territory
- moving people
- fucking events
- transfer cargo (besides selling and buying)


EVENTS
- plague event which slowly increases values and kills population, can deliver medicine commodities to cure them
