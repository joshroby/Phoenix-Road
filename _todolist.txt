Down the Phoenix Road To Do List


DONE

- foraging saves correctly
- drop off passengers & take on passengers updates map
- starting a survey updates the map (for icon change)
- cargo displays value of each load, taking its qty into account
- explore progress bar goes on sites visited, not sites known of
- roadRefugees puts passengers in correct unit
- disables Take Passengers button when unit cargo is full
- notification when a visited town is removed from map
- a caravan that runs out of fuel creates a single Roadside for everybody
- if unit runs out of fuel/food/water on last day of a route, roadside is properly skipped


IMMEDIATE FIXES



NEXT FEATURE / OPTIMIZATION

- get rid of or streamline inTransit, departed, and route

make passengers eat food
	- and make the provisions predictions accomodate

- SVG tinkering
	- movement animation/transition

- selectUnit zooming animated

- save tutorial on/off state

- a big and unmistakable select circle behind the view.focus.unit

- model.victoryProgress() should weight by people, not sites
	- ie, how many people are fed, warm, and safe?
	- takes into account Passengers and refugees

- Gamen Social Media Optimization
	- twitter cards (https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/optimize-with-cards/guides/getting-started)
	- facebook og:image

- consolidate cargo button
	- appears when you have two loads of a thing less than 100 qty

FUTURE EXPANSIONS

- pop up display for 'who do I know that makes this commodity?'

- easy way to remember where special sites (cartwright, bus, foundry) are

- event log (ie, 'crap what did I just click past?')

- 'pin' a town so all other mouseovers compare values with the pinned town

- a 'notes' file that saves with game so you can tell Future Self what your strategy is

- New Random Events
	- site discovers resource
	- events that earn you reputation in towns
		- find lost/wandering kid
	- increase to your self-defense
	- a very simple 'you get some food'
		- replenishes a food to 100 rather than gives you a new commodity
	- plague events
		- slowly increases values
		- population loss
		- spreads town to town
		- can deliver medicine commodities to cure them (not an event, but still)

- New Infrastructure
	- Canals for flood control (and other benefits?)
	- Cisterns fight fire events (50%)
	- Fire Station kills fire events (100%)
	- Clinic/Hospital for Plague?
	- construction crew upgrades to industry infrastructure?
		- more jobs
	- Reservoir (construction crew project, provides water)
	- Library (requires Old World Ruins)
		- research to discover resources in other sites
		- research to discover sites outside your knownSites
	- Post Office as a infrastructure box
		- only one or two mails available at a time
		- addressed to specific destination site?

- Refugees Expansion
	- have a global count of refugees
	- when a site's hunger gets too crazy (or the other bars?), people leave town
	- when refugees arrive in a site or you find a camp, reduce the global refugee count
	- too many refugees and they'll start joining/pumping up threats
	
- Threats Expansion
	- you can discover their home base
	- you can nullify a threat / reduce its strength
		- as code requires there to at least be one threat, how to manage?
	- arrival events in home base (or elsewhere?)
		- they ask for intel, which queues a raid where they have an advantage
		- tax goods (can take percentage of loads)
		- confiscate goods (take a whole load)
		- discover home base
	- incite rebellion?
	- click on/off an overlay on map to denote threat territories
	- threat types
		- outlaws/bandits
		- warlords
		- ethnofascists who seek to purge undesirables
		- cults
		- straight-up cannibals
		- how do these relate to strength?
- Outriders and Escorts
	- no cargo but provides crew for manpower/defense
	- literally no cargo; can be overburdened and eat in town,
	- otherwise travels with a caravan
	
- Affecting Wages
	- union house
	- school
	- house of worship
	- ham radio station ?

- Warehousing
	- works like trash pile except it doesn't disappear
	- build costs will need to take warehouses into account
	- scuttled units in that location stash commodities in warehouse

- Swamps
	- a 'resource' that can be drained to turn it into River
	- must add sites with swamp to the rivers setup

- Population Growth

- Graph Expansion
	- trailblazing
	- building outposts / new sites

- other only-findable infrastructures?
	- some kind of cult?
	- eventually, enough findable locations that not all of them appear in each play

- what do you do that starts passively spreading civilization / greening needs?
	- once you get a site in the green on all counts, it starts pushing help outward
	- people start migrating out of shitty sites and into green sites (event)

- what can you DISCOVER that greatly helps a lot of towns directly?




MOTHBALLS
- boats
- terrain?
- zoom in / out pays no attention to the location of the mouse
	- need to set a center point (defaults to 500,500 or focus unit?)
	- or takes its value initially but then ignores it until zoom is done?
