Down the Phoenix Road To Do List




IMMEDIATE


NEAR FUTURE
- Put everything into a 1200 x 900 ratio flexbox
- starter commodity should be common
- upgrades instead of standalone builds
	- stone wall replaces pallisade & other such issues
- mouseover on site infrastructure tells you what it does
- prettify preview of units
- fix infrastructure description
- dump cargo when you can't sell it
- build times
- make Unit.eat() consume food/water/fuel differently for different units
	- and fuel only when in transit
- when you select a route, if all units have routes, then start clock
- odd jobs button for units where in ten days you get half-loads of food and water and your rep there dips down the price of a full load of food and water.
	- appears only when you have less than a week's provisions and no local rep

IMMEDIATE FUTURE
- zoom function's impression of where cursor is on map is always derived as if map is zoomed out
- transfer cargo (besides selling and buying)
- pathfinding for multi-step trips
- draw functions for units
- movement animation/transition
- rejigger site labels for legibilityâ€¦ somehow
- a site with Pens and a Saddler but no Tannery should get a big upgrade if you build a tannery, completing the production pipeline.

FAR FUTURE
- fucking events
- boats? terrain?
- trailblazing
- building outposts / new sites
- hardholder territory
- moving people
- warehousing
- caravan
- other only-findable infrastructures
	- some kind of cult?


EVENTS
