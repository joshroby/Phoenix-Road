Down the Phoenix Road To Do List

- tooltip on refresh telling you how much it'll cost
- load game correctly sets reputation at sites




IMMEDIATE
- build sites will enable a build when you have the commodity there but won't take the commodity from your cargo

NEAR FUTURE

- completing a production pipeline
	- when you decrease the price of a commodity, check for infr that take it as inputs
	- decrease the price of that infr's outputs as well
- SVG tinkering
	- draw functions for units
	- movement animation/transition
	- shading on landmarks
- Options
	- turn off model.checkClock()
	- new game sliders (in Options or outside?)
	- turn off map zoom
- Zoom is still wonky
- Post Office as a infrastructure box
	- only one or two mails available at a time
	- addressed to specific destination site

GAMEN
	index.html content setup/injection
	color palette

FAR FUTURE
- a 'notes' file that saves with game so you can tell Future Self what your strategy is
- how do you affect wages?
	- union house
- what benefit do YOU get for building defenses and housing?
- rejigger site labels for legibilityâ€¦ somehow
- fucking events
- trailblazing
- building outposts / new sites
- warlord territory
- warehousing?
- other only-findable infrastructures
	- some kind of cult?
- responsive design in the CSS
- what do you do that starts passively spreading civilization / greening needs?
- two builder units building the same thing at the same time


EVENTS
- plague event which slowly increases values and kills population, can deliver medicine commodities to cure them
- your basic 'something happened to affect commodity prices' event
- increasing / decreasing danger
- find a bike (replaces Kid with a Bike)
- consequences for suboptimal needs?





MOTHBALLS
- odd jobs button
	- in ten days you get half-loads of food and water
	- your rep there dips down the price of a full load of food and water.
	- appears only when you have less than a week's provisions and no local rep
- make Unit.eat() consume food/water/fuel differently for different units
	- and fuel only when in transit
- Construction and Surveying require food
	(replaced by 'join the community' consequences)
- boats? terrain?
