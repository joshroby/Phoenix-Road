NEAR FUTURE

		- ask for intel, which increases danger of knownSites
		- tax goods (can take percentage of loads)
		- confiscate goods (take a whole load)

	- infrastructure with no local source for inputs does not decrease outputs
- SVG tinkering
	- movement animation/transition
	- shading on landmarks
	- fix unit svgs to have no overlapping paths
		- then can implement the background stroke
- Zoom is still wonky
	- need to set a center point (defaults to 500,500 or focus unit?)
	- zoom in / out pays no attention to the location of the mouse
		- or takes its value initially but then ignores it until zoom is done?

- how do you affect wages?
	- union house
- what benefit do YOU get for building defenses and housing?
- rejigger site labels for legibilityâ€¦ somehow
- trailblazing
- building outposts / new sites
- warlord territory
- warehousing
	- works like trash pile except it doesn't disappear
	- build costs will need to take warehouses into account
- other only-findable infrastructures?
	- some kind of cult?
	
- responsive design in the CSS
- what do you do that starts passively spreading civilization / greening needs?
- two builder units building the same thing at the same time

- what can you DISCOVER that greatly helps a lot of towns directly?


EVENTS
- plague event which slowly increases values and kills population, can deliver medicine commodities to cure them

MOTHBALLS
- odd jobs button
	- in ten days you get half-loads of food and water
