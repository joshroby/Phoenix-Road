Down the Phoenix Road To Do List


DONE

fixed many problems with destroyInfrastructure()

units loaded from save with routes no longer have their randomized locations

model.startscore moved to player object and saved/loaded

ghost towns do not display your rep

when you depopulate a ghost town, your rep there is erased
	
'unit has run out of food' passage now has a 'well buy some food, stupid' button

zeppelins no longer encounter aurochs, bandits, or refugees on the road

raid and wars registered with random events so will now occur

IMMEDIATE FIXES

- cache has trading items?
	- cannot confirm

NEXT FEATURE / OPTIMIZATION

- tool tips for resources

- how many no-result surveys have happened at a site?

- construction crew upgrades to industry infrastructure?

- limit size of site carpets by site population - little towns have little footprints

- Gamen Crowdfunding Support Link

- refugees arrive at ghost town needs different text

- Wooden Palisade seems too common?

- select tabs on bottom of unit pane need stronger border line on current selection

- when building new infrastructure that produces a new commodity
	- modify the commodity set point
	- set adjustment to 'return to set point'

- supplying inputs should reduce associated output values (as transactions)

- Build Complete passage needs a 'take me there' button

- drag needs to take zoom into account

- start new game with zoomed in map on hometown

- when a unit arrives at a site, switch off Offroad automatically
	- but not zeppelins

- event pop up when you use an upgrade site

- marker on map to indicate amount of credit you have at different sites

- make the randomevents list sequester what just happened so you don't get repeats
	- slowly feed sequestered events back in

- event log (ie, 'crap what did I just click past?')

- when you drop passengers into a ghost town with no neighbors, check to see if nearest neighbor is within max dist and create a road (both ways)

- tinker pulldown displays something to indicate what can and can't be built

- New Random Events
	- threat gains strength
	- threat loses strength
	- site discovers resource
	- events that earn you reputation in towns
	- increase to your self-defense
	- plague events
		- slowly increases values
		- population loss
		- spreads town to town
		- can deliver medicine commodities to cure them (not an event, but still)

- 'drought in <ghost town>' is silly
- 'drought in <riverside town>' could be filtered out
- 'fire in <ghost town>' however, should burn down all or nearly all the infrastructure


- event log (ie, 'crap what did I just click past?')

- Post Office as a infrastructure box
	- only one or two mails available at a time
	- addressed to specific destination site?
	
- Playing with Threats
	- you can discover their home base
	- you can nullify a threat / reduce its strength
	- arrival events
		- ask for intel, which increases danger of knownSites
		- tax goods (can take percentage of loads)
		- confiscate goods (take a whole load)
- overhaul production buildings effect on values
	- port it over to the adjustments code
	- make eachDay's adjustments go up and down pipelines
	- infrastructure with no local source for inputs does not decrease outputs
- SVG tinkering
	- movement animation/transition
	- landmark draw functions
- zoom in / out pays no attention to the location of the mouse
	- need to set a center point (defaults to 500,500 or focus unit?)
	- or takes its value initially but then ignores it until zoom is done?
- New Infrastructure
	- Canals for flood control (and other benefits?)
	- Cisterns fight fire events (50%)
	- Fire Station kills fire events (100%)
	- Clinic/Hospital for Plague?
- Populate and test the Event Stack
- Cancel route while in the midst of route.  Use "Roadside" code.

- If you get hit by bandits and surrender the cargo before you get to your first destination, the tutorial craps out.  Maybe prevent bandits from spawning for the first fifty days or something?

- Refugees Upgrade
	- have a global count of refugees
	- when a site's hunger gets too crazy (or the other bars?), people leave town
	- when refugees arrive in a site or you find a camp, reduce the global refugee count

GAMEN
	color palette
	pronoun substitution
	prettyNumber(2) -> "two"
	responsive design in the CSS

FUTURE EXPANSIONS
- Library infrastructure (not buildable / Old World Ruins upgrade)
	- research to discover resources in other sites
- a 'notes' file that saves with game so you can tell Future Self what your strategy is
- how do you affect wages?
	- union house
	- school
	- house of worship
- what benefit do YOU get for building housing?
	- housing defends against plague and… what other random events?
- trailblazing
- building outposts / new sites
- warehousing
	- works like trash pile except it doesn't disappear
	- build costs will need to take warehouses into account
	- scuttled units in that location stash commodities in warehouse
- other only-findable infrastructures?
	- some kind of cult?
	- eventually, enough findable locations that not all of them appear in each play
- what do you do that starts passively spreading civilization / greening needs?
	- once you get a site in the green on all counts, it starts pushing help outward
	- people start migrating out of shitty sites and into green sites (event)
- swamp 'resource' that can be drained to get… something
- what can you DISCOVER that greatly helps a lot of towns directly?




MOTHBALLS
- odd jobs button
	- in ten days you get half-loads of food and water
	- your rep there dips down the price of a full load of food and water.
	- appears only when you have less than a week's provisions and no local rep
- Construction and Surveying require food
	(replaced by 'join the community' consequences)
- boats? terrain?
