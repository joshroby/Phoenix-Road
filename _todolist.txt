Down the Phoenix Road To Do List


DONE
- Warehousing
	- works like trash pile except it doesn't disappear
	- saves and loads warehouse contents
	- scuttled units in that location stash commodities in warehouse
	- canAfford takes warehouses into account
	- charging build costs will need to take warehouses into account
	- events that destroy warehouses also destroy warehouse contents
- New Buildings: Canals, Fire Station, Carpentry Shop
	- fire suppression infrastructure (Cisterns, Canals, Fire Station)
	- flood control infrastructure (Canals)
	- carpenters make furniture; furniture now required for big housing projects
- Miscellaneous Gameplay Adjustments
	- More pastures, corrals, and tanneries
	- increased number of people employed at many infrastructures
	- increased defense scores of most defenses
	- cannot leave commodities on side of road (and lose them) while in transit
	- local values return to set point slightly faster
	- fatal bugs in plague and fire events fixed
	- a bug that caused every fight with bandits to result in failure is fixed
	- when bandits hit your units, the pop-up message allows you to immediately pull over
- Miscellaneous UI Fixes
	- selected unit marked on map (when there is more than one unit)
	- unique places and fuel stations marked on map
	- Explore: and Rebuild: have spaces after colons and before percentages
	- explore does not go above 100%
	- map is updated when you build a new unit
	- removed plusses and minuses on values as their global comparisons were useless
	- highlighted locally high and locally low values
	- hitting return in rename field submits new name
	- the play button will add an eachDay event to the clock events queue if none exists
	- survey results tell you how many times you've surveyed there and how many times you've found nothing
	- loaded games remember what their save game name is
	- fixed a save error that could corrupt unit routes


IMMEDIATE FIXES
- when caravans run out of food/water, things go hinky

NEXT FEATURE / OPTIMIZATION

- get rid of or streamline inTransit, departed, and route

- SVG tinkering
	- movement animation/transition

- selectUnit zooming animated

- save tutorial on/off state

- consolidate cargo button
	- appears when you have two loads of a thing less than 100 qty

FUTURE EXPANSIONS

- building infrastructure and building units should use the same function to charge costs
	- it should handle fractional loads of commodities (currently only uses 100% loads)

- pop up display for 'who do I know that makes this commodity?'

- event log (ie, 'crap what did I just click past?')
	- put this in gamen

- a 'notes' file that saves with game so you can tell Future Self what your strategy is
	- put this in gamen

- 'pin' a town so all other mouseovers compare values with the pinned town

- New Random Events
	- site discovers resource
	- events that earn you reputation in towns
		- find lost/wandering kid
	- increase to your self-defense
	- a very simple 'you get some food'
		- replenishes a food to 100 rather than gives you a new commodity

- New Infrastructure
	- Library (requires Old World Ruins)
		- research to discover resources in other sites
		- research to discover sites outside your knownSites
	- Post Office as a infrastructure box
		- only one or two mails available at a time (spawn in eachDay event)
		- addressed to specific destination site?

- Affecting Wages
	- union house
	- school
	- house of worship
	- ham radio station ?


- Refugees Expansion
	- have a global count of refugees
	- when a site's hunger gets too crazy (or the other bars?), people leave town
	- when refugees arrive in a site or you find a camp, reduce the global refugee count
	- too many refugees and they'll start joining/pumping up threats
	- model.victoryProgress() should weight by people, not sites
		- ie, how many people are fed, warm, and safe?
		- takes into account Passengers and global refugee total
	
- Threats Expansion
	- you can discover their home base
	- you can nullify a threat / reduce its strength
		- as code requires there to at least be one threat, how to manage?
	- arrival events in home base (or elsewhere?)
		- they ask for intel, which queues a raid where they have an advantage
		- tax goods (can take percentage of loads)
		- confiscate goods (take a whole load)
		- discover home base
	- incite rebellion?
	- click on/off an overlay on map to denote threat territories
	- threat types
		- outlaws/bandits
		- warlords
		- ethnofascists who seek to purge undesirables
		- cults
		- straight-up cannibals
		- how do these relate to strength?
- Outriders and Escorts
	- no cargo but provides crew for manpower/defense
	- literally no cargo; can be overburdened and eat in town,
	- otherwise travels with a caravan
	
- Plague Expansion
	- Clinic/Hospital for Plague?
	- plague events
		- slowly increases values
		- population loss
		- spreads town to town
		- can deliver medicine commodities to cure them (not an event, but still)
	- Swamps
		- a 'resource' that can be drained to turn it into River
		- must add sites with swamp to the rivers setup

- Population Growth

- Graph Expansion
	- trailblazing
	- building outposts / new sites

- other only-findable infrastructures?
	- some kind of cult?
	- eventually, enough findable locations that not all of them appear in each play

- what do you do that starts passively spreading civilization / greening needs?
	- once you get a site in the green on all counts, it starts pushing help outward
	- people start migrating out of shitty sites and into green sites (event)

- what can you DISCOVER that greatly helps a lot of towns directly?




MOTHBALLS
- boats
	- with a water speed and an portage speed
- terrain?
- zoom in / out pays no attention to the location of the mouse
	- need to set a center point (defaults to 500,500 or focus unit?)
	- or takes its value initially but then ignores it until zoom is done?
