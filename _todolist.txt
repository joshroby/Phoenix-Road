Down the Phoenix Road To Do List


- aurochs encounter only inTransit
- Infrastructure boxes do not display on Ghost Towns
- auto-scuttle bug finally fixed?
- upgrade cost rounded for display
- upgrade now actually charges
- Basic industries set up by commodity values (cheap clothing => Seamstress)
- bolded the commodity listing of things produced locally


IMMEDIATE

- place rivers in sites with low water value

- inputs should not add commodities to the Site.trading() list

- players.p1.hometown not saving
- descriptor for selfDefense not displaying correctly
- Unit.moveStep checks for food but not the whole caravan?
- caravan food stores do not disappear at 0%
- still not taking commodities out of non-focus unitsAtSite

- gamen Passages need to be flagged for unavoidable / default dismiss click Choice

- refugee camps throw the knownValues off

- a loaded game does not pause when a random event comes up?

- make the randomevents list sequester what just happened so you don't get repeats
	- slowly feed sequestered events back in

- event log (ie, 'crap what did I just click past?')

- bandit event
	- bandit event needs a 'run for it'?
	- bandits do not select stuff that you've got qty < 10

- when a unit arrives at a site, switch off Offroad automatically

- when you drop passengers into a ghost town with no neighbors, check to see if nearest neighbor is within max dist and create a road (both ways)

- random events
	- threat gains strength
	- threat loses strength
	- site discovers resource
- respawn random event
	- checks if Tinker Camp, Cartwright, Mechanic, Arena, Lensmeister exist
	- if one doesn't, it spawns one.
	- notifies you if it's a town you've visited
	- if Tinker Camp / Mechanic is destroyed in an event, game becomes nigh-unwinnable.


NEAR FUTURE



- event log (ie, 'crap what did I just click past?')
- Post Office as a infrastructure box
	- only one or two mails available at a time
	- addressed to specific destination site?
- Playing with Threats
	- you can discover their home base
	- you can nullify a threat / reduce its strength
	- view.displaySiteDetails to show threat territory if you've visited
	- arrival events
		- ask for intel, which increases danger of knownSites
		- tax goods (can take percentage of loads)
		- confiscate goods (take a whole load)
- overhaul production buildings effect on values
	- port it over to the adjustments code
	- make eachDay's adjustments go up and down pipelines
	- infrastructure with no local source for inputs does not decrease outputs
- SVG tinkering
	- movement animation/transition
	- landmark draw functions
- Zoom is still wonky
	- zoom in / out pays no attention to the location of the mouse
		- need to set a center point (defaults to 500,500 or focus unit?)
		- or takes its value initially but then ignores it until zoom is done?
- New Infrastructure
	- Canals for flood control (and other benefits?)
	- Cisterns fight fire events (50%)
	- Fire Station kills fire events (100%)
	- Clinic/Hospital for Plague?
- Populate and test the Event Stack
- Cancel route while in the midst of route.  Use "Roadside" code.

GAMEN
	index.html content setup/injection
	color palette
	pronoun substitution
	prettyNumber(2) -> "two"

FAR FUTURE
- eventually, enough findable locations that not all of them appear in each play
- a 'notes' file that saves with game so you can tell Future Self what your strategy is
- how do you affect wages?
	- union house
	- house of worship
- what benefit do YOU get for building housing?
	- housing defends against plague and… what other random events?
- trailblazing
- building outposts / new sites
- warehousing
	- works like trash pile except it doesn't disappear
	- build costs will need to take warehouses into account
- other only-findable infrastructures?
	- some kind of cult?
- responsive design in the CSS
- what do you do that starts passively spreading civilization / greening needs?
- two builder units building the same thing at the same time
- swamp 'resource' that can be drained to get… something
- what can you DISCOVER that greatly helps a lot of towns directly?

- link up the sites with rivers (ha ha, that's funny hard)
	- make a list of all sites with rivers
	- find each river-site's nearest river-site neighbor
	- link up like normal neighbors with a curvy river segment
	- (how to avoid overlapping other sites?)

EVENTS
- plague event which slowly increases values and kills population, can deliver medicine commodities to cure them
- increasing / decreasing danger
- events that earn you reputation in towns





MOTHBALLS
- odd jobs button
	- in ten days you get half-loads of food and water
	- your rep there dips down the price of a full load of food and water.
	- appears only when you have less than a week's provisions and no local rep
- Construction and Surveying require food
	(replaced by 'join the community' consequences)
- boats? terrain?
