Down the Phoenix Road To Do List


- caravan
	- create Caravan button just makes all unitsAtSite into one caravan
		- inCaravan = true
		- caravan = {Unit,Unit,Unit}
	- leave Caravan button drops a unit out of its caravan
	- Unit.move() checks for caravans, then:
		- caravans move at slowest Unit speed
		- caravans share food/water/fuel (this is in Unit.eat())
		- gives identical routes to all Units in caravan
	- Cancel Route cancels all caravan units' routes


IMMEDIATE

Carpet should only display if you've visited that site?
Trash Pile does not display qty
Per Mischa, the donkey belonged to Grams
Nothing stops you from taking 10000 Mail site to site.

'rep cost beyond materials' replace:
	What you write means "You need to pay this much more, poor fucker"
	To get the materials that you aren't already carrying will consume NNN reputation

new Site() sometimes has stuff in Trash Pile
Does build infrastructure assess your partially-consumed commodities?

'Days to Destination' on mouseover needs to use the distance from pathTo()

NEAR FUTURE
- save game

- completing a production pipeline
	- when you decrease the price of a commodity, check for infr that take it as inputs
	- decrease the price of that infr's outputs as well
- SVG tinkering
	- draw functions for units
	- movement animation/transition
	- shading on landmarks
- Options
	- turn off model.checkClock()
	- new game sliders (in Options or outside?)
	- turn off map zoom
- Zoom is still wonky

GAMEN
	index.html content setup/injection
	color palette

FAR FUTURE
- how do you affect wages?
	- union house
- moving people (commodity 'Passengers')
- rejigger site labels for legibilityâ€¦ somehow
- fucking events
- trailblazing
- building outposts / new sites
- warlord territory
- warehousing?
- other only-findable infrastructures
	- some kind of cult?
- responsive design in the CSS
- what do you do that starts passively spreading civilization / greening needs?
- two builder units building the same thing at the same time


EVENTS
- plague event which slowly increases values and kills population, can deliver medicine commodities to cure them
- your basic 'something happened to affect commodity prices' event
- increasing / decreasing danger
- find a bike (replaces Kid with a Bike)
- consequences for suboptimal needs?





MOTHBALLS
- odd jobs button
	- in ten days you get half-loads of food and water
	- your rep there dips down the price of a full load of food and water.
	- appears only when you have less than a week's provisions and no local rep
- make Unit.eat() consume food/water/fuel differently for different units
	- and fuel only when in transit
- Construction and Surveying require food
	(replaced by 'join the community' consequences)
- boats? terrain?
