Down the Phoenix Road To Do List



NEAR FUTURE
- infrastructure raises wages / provides jobs
	- hunger ( wages / food cost )
	- housing ( housing / population )
	- safety ( defense / danger (currently static) )
- upgrades instead of standalone builds
	- stone wall replaces pallisade & other such issues
- mouseover on site infrastructure tells you what it does
- dump cargo when you can't sell it
- build times?
- Unit.moveStep() needs to check overburdened

IMMEDIATE FUTURE
- zoom function's impression of where cursor is on map is always derived as if map is zoomed out
- pathfinding for multi-step trips
- draw functions for units
- movement animation/transition
- rejigger site labels for legibilityâ€¦ somehow
- convert 'goodwill' from flat bonus into an everyday earn instead
- make Unit.eat() consume food/water/fuel differently for different units
	- and fuel only when in transit
- when you select a route, if all units have routes, then start clock
- unit tabs reflect inTransit and cargo capacity

FAR FUTURE
- boats? terrain?
- trailblazing
- building outposts / new sites
- hardholder territory
- moving people
- fucking events
- transfer cargo (besides selling and buying)
- visible progress on map (spreading carpet of green?)
- warehousing
- caravan
- other only-findable infrastructures
	- some kind of cult?


EVENTS
- plague event which slowly increases values and kills population, can deliver medicine commodities to cure them
- your basic 'something happened to affect commodity prices' event
