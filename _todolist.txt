Down the Phoenix Road To Do List

- Units without food eventually "find a place in the community"
	- popup when food hits 0, 'doing odd jobs'
	- add Crew to population
	- last unit lost triggers endgame

- win state

IMMEDIATE





NEAR FUTURE
- pathfinding for multi-step trips
- caravan
	- link units together so that changing one's destination changes them all
- completing a production pipeline
	- when you decrease the price of a commodity, check for infr that take it as inputs
	- decrease the price of that infr's outputs as well
- SVG tinkering
	- draw functions for units
	- movement animation/transition
	- shading on landmarks
- Options
	- turn off model.checkClock()
	- new game sliders (in Options or outside?)
- Zoom is still wonky

GAMEN
	index.html content setup/injection
	color palette

FAR FUTURE
- save game
- how do you affect wages?
	- meeting house?
- moving people (commodity 'Passengers')
- rejigger site labels for legibilityâ€¦ somehow
- fucking events
- boats? terrain?
- trailblazing
- building outposts / new sites
- hardholder territory
- warehousing?
- other only-findable infrastructures
	- some kind of cult?
- responsive design in the CSS
- what do you do that starts passively spreading civilization / greening needs?


EVENTS
- plague event which slowly increases values and kills population, can deliver medicine commodities to cure them
- your basic 'something happened to affect commodity prices' event
- increasing / decreasing danger
- find a bike (replaces Kid with a Bike)
- consequences for suboptimal needs?





MOTHBALLS
- odd jobs button
	- in ten days you get half-loads of food and water
	- your rep there dips down the price of a full load of food and water.
	- appears only when you have less than a week's provisions and no local rep
- make Unit.eat() consume food/water/fuel differently for different units
	- and fuel only when in transit
- Construction and Surveying require food
	(replaced by 'join the community' consequences)
